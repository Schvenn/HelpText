# HelpText
PowerShell module to generate help menus for scripts on the fly.

Running the module as a stand-alone script, you can pass a full file path, or just the name of any alias, function or module located in the user's PowerShell directory, and the module will attempt to resolve those paths in order to provide the proper helptext menus for them.
